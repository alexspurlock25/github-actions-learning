# Learning GitHub Actions

A simple project where I'm learning GitHub Actions and CI/CD workflows.

## What I'm Learning

- Setting up GitHub Actions workflows
- Building C++ projects with CMake
- Automating builds on push
- Running different actions (C++, Python)

## Building Locally

```bash
cmake -B build
cmake --build build
./build/GitHubActions
```

## Project Structure

```
├── .github/workflows/     # GitHub Actions workflows
├── src/main.cpp          # Simple C++ program
└── CMakeLists.txt        # CMake configuration that GitHub Actions uses.
```

That's it! Just experimenting and learning.
